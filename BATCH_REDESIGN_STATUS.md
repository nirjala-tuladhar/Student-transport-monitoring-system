Working on rapid batch redesign of all remaining screens...

## Strategy

Due to the large number of screens (25 remaining), I'm applying the redesign systematically:

1. **Critical Entry Points** (Login screens) - Priority 1
2. **Main Dashboards** (Home screens) - Priority 2  
3. **Management Screens** (CRUD operations) - Priority 3
4. **Secondary Screens** (Settings, etc.) - Priority 4

---

## Time Estimate

- Average: 10-15 minutes per screen
- Remaining: ~6-8 hours of work
- Recommendation: Continue in phases
